## Flex
--Kevin Powell is one of my favorite youtubers to talk about anything CSS. With useful tips and insight, Kevin Powell expertly introduces concepts. One of those concepts was Flexbox.

Heres an awesome video that goes over the following topics:

    1. What happens when we declare display: flex;
    2. Flex-grow
    3. Dealing with more content
    4. making even columns
    5. flex-direction
    6. justify-content
    7. problems people run into with justify-content
    8. align-items

--Flexbox Playground is a place to test different flex properties.

    My favorite part of this resource is that it lets you know what properties are declared on flex containers vs flex items.
